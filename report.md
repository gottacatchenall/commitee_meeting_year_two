# Summary

This is the annual report for my committee meeting, year two, Sept 22 2021. What
is in this document? A brief recap of the status/outline of each chapter,
timeline for the next year of work, and a prospectus on the next steps re (3rd
meeting/future courses/ta-ing) etc.

# Introduction

Developing a predictive theory of ecology is an imperative, both to root our
understanding of ecosystem function in predictive capacity [@Dietze2017PreEco],
but also because of the applied need to make robust, actionable forecasts of how
ecosystem composition and functioning will change in the future [@Dietze2017].

Effective prediction has long evaded ecological systems as they are variable,
high-dimensional, and the intrinsic dynamics are often unknown
[@SymbolicRegression], and some [@Pennekamp].

Inference and forecasting in ecology. Simulation based inference has proven
effective in the modeling of complex systems (numerical weather prediction; @Num).
Core theme of my dissertation is understanding how simulation tools and methods
can aid predictive ecology.

The purpose of this document is to: briefly outline of each dissertation
chapter, with in-progress work for what's done, goal-figures for what isn't.

One-sentence per chapter here.

Then to present a timetable of work for the next year. A discussion of other
side projects. A discussion of courses and TAing for the next year.


# Dissertation status

## Disseration Introduction

What's the deal with community ecology and global change. Wild stuff.

## Chapter one (_The missing link: differentiating true from false negatives when sampling species interactions_)

This opening chapters serves as a vignette of how simulation can have pragmatic use in ecology.

Include some of the better figs.

## Chapter two (_Generative learning for predictive ecology_)

We need to predict interactions between species.

Data on species interactions is limited. Many conceptual models have been
proposed to explain food-web structure which fit data reasonably well.

Predictive models could feasibly be trained on simulated data to predict
interactions in empirical systems.

In this chapter we (hopefully) show training a model on entirely simulated data can enable
effective prediction of interactions.

## Chapter three (_Optimizing corridor placement_)

Corridors to increase landscape connectivity. In an ideal world we could build
corridors between each pair of locations, but the realities of funding mean we
have a limited amount of Earth's surface for which we can change the surface
cover. So where is the best place to put a corridor given a constraint on how
much area you can change?

## Chapter four ("software chapter.... maybe")



## Disseration Conclusion

Half summary, half future directions for this work
